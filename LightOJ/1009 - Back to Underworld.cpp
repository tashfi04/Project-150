/*
Algorithm: BFS

Check the second test case:
1 2
2 3
4 2

We denote the fighters as the nodes of a graph and the fights to be the edges of the graph.
Let's assume 1 is Vampire. So 2 must be a Lykan, as there is an edge between 1 and 2 (a fight). And
3 and 4 will be Vampires, as they have edges with 2. So there are 3 Vampires and 1 Lykan, 
the answer is 3. In short, if a node is Vampire, every node adjacent to it will be Lykans,
and vice versa.

Look, here we don't care about if the fighter is a Vampire of Lykan, we only care the maximum 
number of fighters of a certain kind. So if we assume 1 to be a Lykan, the result doesn't change,
we would have 3 Lykans and 1 Vampire, the answer being 3.

In my code I denoted Vampires and Lykans by two different colors, black and red. At first all
nodes are unassigned. Then I select an unassigned node and make it black (or red, whatever).
Using a BFS, I assign red to every node adjacent to a black node, and assign black
to every node adjacent to a red node. Then I take the maximum between the red and black nodes.

One thing to remember, the graph might not be connected.
